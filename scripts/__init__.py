"""
Build and cleanup scripts for Python projects.

These scripts often utilize modern tooling like UV (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
or standard tools like pip, build, and PyInstaller for package management,
building distributions, and creating executables. They aim to be configurable
and adaptable to different project structures.
